Quickstart
==========

::

    # Install pipx if cookiecutter are not installed
    python -m pip install --user pipx
    python -m pipx ensurepath
    
    # **Close current terminal and open a new one**
    # Use cookiecutter to create project from this template
    pipx run cookiecutter https://github.com/HuangKaiHuan/cookiecutter-rrpylibrary.git

    # Push initial commit
    cd existing_folder
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "First commit"
    git tag 0.1.0 (must 0.1.0)

    # Create virtualenv(recommend)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -e .[dev]

    # Setup pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg hooks
    pre-commit install -t pre-commit
    pre-commit install -t pre-push
    pre-commit install -t commit-msg

    # Push to remote repo, you should create a repo first.
    git remote add origin git@$repo_hosting_domain:$repo_username/$project_name.git
    git push -u origin master

Developing the project
======================

You should read `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_ before doing a commit.

To run all the tests, just run::

    tox

To see all the tox environments::

    tox -l

To only build the docs::

    tox -e docs

To run all check::

    pre-commit run -a

Version management
==================

You should read `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <http://semver.org/>`_ before bumping versions.

* ``invoke bumpversion patch`` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`.
* ``invoke bumpversion minor`` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`.
* ``invoke bumpversion major`` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`.

At the same time, it will auto update the changelog.

Building and uploading
======================

Before building dists make sure you got a clean build area::

    invoke clean

Note:

    Dirty ``build`` or ``egg-info`` dirs can cause problems: missing or stale files in the resulting dist or
    strange and confusing errors. Avoid having them around.

Then you should check that you got no packaging issues::

    pre-commit run -a

And then you can build the ``sdist``, and if possible, the ``bdist_wheel`` too::

    python setup.py clean --all sdist bdist_wheel

To make a release of the project on PyPI, assuming you got some distributions in ``dist/``, the most simple usage is::

    twine upload --skip-existing dist/*.whl dist/*.gz dist/*.zip

Note:

    `twine <https://pypi.org/project/twine>`_ is a tool that you can use to securely upload your releases to PyPI.
    You can still use the old ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload`` but it's not very secure - your PyPI
    password will be sent over plaintext.
